# [üáÆüá±](https://emojipedia.org/flag-israel) Israel-Specific 

Home Assistant components and projects that are specifically relevant for people living in Israel.

## **[üö®](https://emojipedia.org/police-car-light) Red Alert (Tzeva Adom) Warning Integrations**

Integrations that work with Israel's national emergency warning system, operated by Pikud HaOref (Home Front Command). Note: the integrations are third-party projects and are not operated by Pikud HaOref. Test before relying upon these. 

- [RedAlert](https://github.com/idodov/RedAlert)  - This component is available from HACS. It creates configurable sensors for Red Alert warnings that can be used to drive automations, etc.
- [Oref Alert](https://github.com/amitfin/oref_alert)- Also available from HACS. Component works similarly. You can also create a testing sensor to verify that you have the alerts configured properly.

## Other Home Assistant Projects For Israeli Users

- [Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) Weather Sensor](https://github.com/t0mer/ims-custom-component) - This sensor integrates with updates from Israel's national weather provider. 
- [Israeli School Vacation Days](https://github.com/rt400/School-Vacation) - This sensor checks whether it's a day off from school or not according to Israel's school calendar

# [‚ú°Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/star-of-david) Of Jewish Interest

These projects might be of interest if you are Jewish (want Shabbat times through your HA instance, etc).

- [Jewish Sabbaths and Holidays](https://github.com/rt400/Jewish-Sabbaths-Holidays) - This is an incredibly helpful integration which uses the [HebCal API](https://www.hebcal.com/home/developer-apis) to expose times for Shabbat, Yom Tov and religious observance as sensors in Home Assistant.
- [Jewish Calendar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/jewish_calendar/) - Home Assistant also ships with a 'Jewish Calendar' integration which provides sensors for the weekly Torah portion, the omer count, and even the Daf Yomi!
- [Molad sensor](https://github.com/chaimchaikin/molad-ha) - For exposing the Molad and Rosh Hodesh times as sensors in Home Assistant

## Documentation & Blog Posts

- I've written a few blogs about using the Jewish Sabbaths and Holidays sensor to drive automations. See, [this post](https://www.danielontech.com/an-easy-shabbat-automation-for-home-assistant/) for a start.
- [Example from the Home Assistant community forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/automating-an-entire-day/398731) of setting up automations for Shabbat observance.
